## Discord-Image-logger-
## A simple Image logger that steal ip and info from it

For dev this code, You need to host it. Personely I use vercel for this version.
You need to structure your repository with a folder that you name 'api' where there are  files '.gitkeep'  a 'requiremets.txt' and the file.py.
Rember that you need to change the webhook content and file.py's settings.

After you host it you're gonna have a link that      `(random)vercel.app/`
You just have to add `api/{name-of-your-file.py}` at the end of url. You  have now that  `(random)vercel.app/api/{name-of-your-file.py}`
